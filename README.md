**QRDX Chain** is a quantum-resistant decentralized blockchain built entirely in Python and utilizes PostgreSQL for blockchain data. It offers a blockchain implementation that developers can understand and extend without the complexity often found in traditional cryptocurrency codebases. Additionally, it can serve as a foundation for developers that are interested in creating their own quantum-resistant cryptocurrency.

## Node Setup

**Automated configuration and deployment of a QRDX node can be achieved by using either the `setup.sh` script or `Docker`. Both methods ensure that all prerequisites for operating a QRDX node are met and properly configured according to the user's preference.**

<details>
<summary><b>Setup via setup.sh:</b></summary>

<dl><dd>

The `setup.sh` script is designed for traditional configuration and deployment of a single QRDX node. It automatically handles system package updates, manages environment variables, configures the PostgreSQL database, sets up a Python virtual environment, installs the required Python dependencies, and runs the QRDX node.


**Quick Start:**

<dl><dd>

  ```bash
  # Clone the QRDX repository to your local machine.
  git clone https://github.com/The-Sycorax/qrdx-chain-denaro.git
  
  # Change directory to the cloned repository.
  cd qrdx-chain-denaro
  
  # Make the setup script executable.
  chmod +x setup.sh
  
  # Execute the setup script with optional arguments if needed.
  ./setup.sh [--skip-prompts] [--setup-db] [--skip-package-install]
  ```
</dl></dd>

<dl><dd>

<details>
<summary><b>CLI Arguments:</b></summary>

<dl><dd>
<dl><dd>

- `--skip-prompts`: Executes the setup script in an automated manner without requiring user input, bypassing all interactive prompts.
  
- `--setup-db`: Limits the setup script's actions to only configure the PostgreSQL database, excluding the execution of other operations such as virtual environment setup and dependency installation.

- `--skip-package-install`: Skips `apt` package installation. This argument can be used for Linux distributions that do not utilize `apt` as a package manager. However, it is important that the required system packages are installed prior to running the setup script (For more details refer to: *Installation for Non-Debian Based Systems*).

</dd></dl>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Installation for Non-Debian Based Systems:</b></summary>

<dl><dd>
<dl><dd>

 The setup script is designed for Linux distributions that utilize `apt` as their package manager (e.g. Debian/Ubuntu). If system package installation is unsuccessful, it is most likely due to the absence of `apt` on your system. This is generally the case for Non-Debian Linux distributions. Therefore, the required system packages must be installed manually.

<details>
<summary><b>Required Packages:</b></summary>
<dl><dd>

*Note: It is nessessary to ensure that the package names specified are adjusted to correspond with those recognized by your package manager.*

- `gcc`
- `libgmp-dev`
- `libpq-dev`
- `postgresql-15`
- `python3`
- `python3-venv`
- `sudo`
  
</dd></dl>
</details>

Once the required packages have been installed, the `--skip-package-install` argument can be used with the setup script to bypass operations that require `apt`. This should mitigate any unsucessful execution related to package installation, allowing the setup script to proceed.

<summary><b>Setup via Docker:</b></summary>

<dl><dd>

The Docker setup provides a containerized deployment option for QRDX nodes. Unlike the `setup.sh` script, it encapsulates everything needed to run a QRDX node in isolated Docker containers. This avoids installing dependencies on the host system and prevents conflicts with system packages. Additionally, the Docker setup allows for multi-node deployments, while the `setup.sh` script does not.

At the core of the Docker setup is the `docker-entrypoint.sh` script, which automates the configuration and deployment of each node. When a node's container starts, this script automatically provisions the PostgreSQL database, generates the necessary environment configuration, handles bootstrap node selection, and starts the QRDX node. Docker coordinates the supporting services, shared resources, and startup order of each container. 

To test public node behavior over the Internet, the Docker setup includes optional support for exposing a node on the Internet by establishing an SSH reverse tunnel via [Pinggy.io's free tunnleing service](https://www.pinggy.io). *For more information please refer to: [2025-09-18-refactor(docker).md: Optional Public Node Tunnleing](https://github.com/The-Sycorax/denaro/blob/main/changelogs/2025/09/2025-09-18-refactor(docker).md#optional-public-node-tunnleing)*.


**Quick Start:**

<dl><dd>

```bash
# Clone the QRDX repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/The-Sycorax/qrdx-chain-denaro.git

# Change directory to the cloned repository.

<summary><b>Important Notes:</b></summary>

<dl><dd>

***This information is meant to document the correct requirements for the Docker setup. This applies primarily to advanced setups and custom configurations. The default `docker-compose.yml` and examples above already satisfy these requirements.***

- Each node service must include the `<<: *qrdx-node-base` merge. This ensures that Docker Compose applies the required `qrdx.node=true` label, mounts the shared volumes, and establishes the baseline dependencies on services that are required by the entrypoint script.

- Each node service requires its own dedicated volume (for example, `node_3006_data`) mounted to `/app`. This volume preserves the node's blockchain data, configuration files, and application state across container restarts. Additionally, this volume should not be shared with other nodes, doing so may result in data loss.

- Each node service must be assigned a unique `NODE_NAME` and `QRDX_NODE_PORT` value. The entrypoint script uses these values to derive per-node database names and healthcheck targets. Duplicate values will cause database conflicts and prevent proper node identification.

- The shared `node-registry` and `node-topology` volumes must remain mounted on all node services. These volumes enable the entrypoint script to coordinate peer discovery through the shared registry and provide the dependency information required by the topology-aware healthcheck system.

- When configuring multi-node deployments, use `depends_on` with the `service_healthy` condition to establish startup ordering. This ensures that Docker Compose waits for upstream peer nodes to become healthy before launching dependent nodes, preventing bootstrap connection failures during startup.

## Running a QRDX Node

*Note: This section dose not apply to nodes deployed using Docker.*

A QRDX node can be started manually if you have already executed the `setup.sh` script and chose not to start the node immediately, or if you need to start the node in a new terminal session. If the setup script was used with the `--setup-db` argument or manual installation was performed, it is reccomended that a Python virtual environment is created and that the required Python packages are installed prior to starting a node.

**Commands to manually start a node:**

<dl><dd>

```bash
# Navigate to the QRDX directory.
cd path/to/qrdx-chain-denaro

# Create a Python virtual environment (Optional).
sudo apt install python3-venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages if needed.
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the QRDX Node
python3 run_node.py

# Manualy start the QRDX node via uvicorn (Optional).
uvicorn qrdx.node.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3006 

# To stop the node, press Ctrl+C in the terminal.
```

</dl></dd>

**To exit a Python virtual environment:**

<dl><dd>

```bash
deactivate
```

</dl></dd>

## Nodeless Wallet Setup
To setup a nodeless wallet, use [QRDX Wallet Client GUI](https://github.com/The-Sycorax/QRDXWalletClient-GUI).

## Mining

**QRDX** adopts a Proof of Work (PoW) system for mining using SHA256 hashing, with dynamic difficulty adjustment every 512 blocks to maintain a target block time of 180 seconds (3 minutes).

<details>
<summary><b>Mining Details:</b></summary>

<dl><dd>

- **Block Hashing**:
  - Utilizes the SHA256 algorithm for block hashing.
  - The hash of a block must begin with the last `difficulty` hexadecimal characters of the hash from the previously mined block.
  - `difficulty` can have decimal digits, which restricts the `difficulty + 1`st character of the derived hash to have a limited set of values.

    ```python
    from math import ceil

    difficulty = 6.3
    decimal = difficulty % 1

    charset = '0123456789abcdef'
    count = ceil(16 * (1 - decimal))
    allowed_characters = charset[:count]
    ```

- **Difficulty Adjustment**:
  - Difficulty adjusts every 512 blocks based on the actual block time versus the target block time of 180 seconds (3 minutes).
  - Starting difficulty is 6.0.

- **Block Size and Capacity**:
  - Maximum block size is 2MB (raw bytes), equivalent to 4MB in hexadecimal format.
  - Transaction data is limited to approximately 1.9MB hex characters per block.

- **Rewards**:
  - Block rewards start at 64 QRDX and decrease by half every 262,144 blocks until they reach zero.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Mining Software:</b></summary>

<dl><dd>

- **CPU Mining**:

  The CPU miner script (`./miner/cpu_miner.py`) can be used to mine QRDX.
          
  <details>
  <summary><b>Usage:</b></summary>
  <dl><dd>
  
  - **Syntax**:
      ```bash
      python3 miner/cpu_miner.py [-h] [-a ADDRESS] [-n NODE] [-w WORKERS] [-m MAX_BLOCKS]
      ```
  
  - **Arguments**:
        
      * `--address`, `-a` (Required): Your public QRDX wallet address where mining rewards will be sent.

      * `--node`, `-n` (Optional): The URL or IP address of the QRDX node to connect to. Defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:3006/`.

      * `--workers`, `-w` (Optional): The number of parallel processes to run. It's recommended to set this to the number of CPU cores you want to use for mining. Defaults to 1.

      * `--max-blocks`, `-m` (Optional): Maximum number of blocks to mine before exiting. If not specified, the miner will continue indefinitely.

      * `--help`, `-h`: Shows the help message.

  <details>
  <summary><b>Examples:</b></summary>
  <dl><dd>
  
  - #### Basic Mining (Single Core)    
    ```bash
    python3 miner/cpu_miner.py --address WALLET_ADDRESS
    ```
  
  - #### Mining while connected to a Remote Node    
    ```bash
    python3 miner/cpu_miner.py --address WALLET_ADDRESS --node http://a-public-node.com:3006
    ```
  
  - #### Mining with Multiple Cores    
    ```bash
    python3 miner/cpu_miner.py --address WALLET_ADDRESS --workers 8
    ```

## Blockchain Synchronization

**QRDX** nodes maintain synchronization with the network through automatic peer discovery and chain validation mechanisms that ensure all nodes converge on the longest valid chain. Additionally nodes can also be manually synchronized.

<details>
<summary><b>Automatic Synchronization:</b></summary>

<dl><dd>

Nodes automatically detect and synchronize with longer chains through two mechanisms:

- **Handshake Synchronization**: When connecting to a peer, nodes exchange chain state information. If the peer has a longer valid chain, synchronization is triggered immediately.

- **Periodic Chain Discovery**: A background task polls 2 random peers every 60 seconds to check for longer chains, ensuring the node remains synchronized even without new connections.

</dd></dl>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Manual Synchronization:</b></summary>

<dl><dd>

To manually initiate blockchain synchronization, a request can be sent to a node's `/sync_blockchain` endpoint:

<dl><dd>

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3006/sync_blockchain
```

</dl></dd>

<dl><dd>

The endpoint accepts an optional `node_id` parameter to sync from a specific peer. The node ID of a peer can be found in the `./qrdx/node/nodes.json` file:

<dl><dd>

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:3006/sync_blockchain?node_id=NODE_ID"
```

</dl></dd>
<dl><dd>
The endpoint returns an error if a sync operation is already in progress.

</dd></dl>
