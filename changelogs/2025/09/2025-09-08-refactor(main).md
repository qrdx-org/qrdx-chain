### Overview & Security:
  - This change represents a complete networking and security refactor for `qrdx/node/main.py`. qrdx nodes now uses authenticated, signed peer-to-peer requests, a structured handshake, and a hardened sync pipeline (with fork handling and pull/push sync). Resource limits and input validation have been tightened across the board. 
  
  - Several API endpoints have been replaced or split by trust level (peer vs. external client). A new security subsystem (caches, reputation, DNS protections, query cost accounting) underpins request handling and propagation. Startup and middleware flows have been simplified and made deterministic.

  - Signed peer requests are verified in a consistent format and protected against replay (timestamp + nonce). Outbound calls pin DNS; reserved/loopback/link-local ranges are always rejected, and private IPs are rejected when the local node is public. Private nodes may contact private IPs on the same network. 
  
  - Propagation runs under a global concurrency cap; expensive endpoints apply per-client query budgets. TTL caches reduce duplicate work. A global sync gate (`SyncStateManager`) ensures only one synchronization runs at a time.
